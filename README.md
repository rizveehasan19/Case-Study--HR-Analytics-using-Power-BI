# Case-Study--HR-Analytics-using-Power-BI

In this latest case study, I've analyzed a fictional company's HR domain data and visualized the insights through an interactive dashboard. Here are some key highlights:

✨Overview - Here I have communicated the hiring trends & the overall distribution of employees across multiple roles & departments

✨Demographics - In this tab I have discussed the employee distribution based on several demographic criterias such as Age, Marital Status, ethnicity etc

✨Performance Tracker - Then I have observed employee performances & feedbacks

✨Attrition - Finally I have visualized several trends to observe employee attrition or retention  

Please feel free to contact me for more details about the analysis or any feedback
